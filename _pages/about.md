Hi! I am Chia-Chun Yang, a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Operations, Business Analytics, and Information Systems (OBAIS) at the [Carl H. Lindner College of Business, University of Cincinnati](https://business.uc.edu/), advised by Professors [Craig Froehle](https://business.uc.edu/faculty-research/obais/faculty/craig-froehle.html) and [Yinghao Zhang](https://business.uc.edu/faculty-research/obais/faculty/yinghao-zhang.html). I am seeking Opportunities for 2025-2026 Academic Job Market. 
<br>&emsp;&emsp;My research interests revolve around the intersection of service operations management, human behavior, and technology. By understanding the behaviors of managers, front-line employees, and customers in service settings, especially in contexts involving advanced technologies, I aim to generate insights that can significantly benefit practical applications in the operations management field. Beyond research, I am a passionate educator with a strong record of teaching undergraduate and graduate courses, delivered both in-person and online, in operations management, data analysis, and decision modeling. Additinoally, my academic background and industry experience have prepared me to teach a broader range of courses, including supply chain management, logistics, service operations, and more.
