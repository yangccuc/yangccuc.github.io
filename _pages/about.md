Hi! I am Chia-Chun Yang, a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Operations, Business Analytics, and Information Systems (OBAIS) at the [Carl H. Lindner College of Business, University of Cincinnati](https://business.uc.edu/), under the advice of Professors [Craig Froehle](https://business.uc.edu/faculty-research/obais/faculty/craig-froehle.html) and [Yinghao Zhang](https://business.uc.edu/faculty-research/obais/faculty/yinghao-zhang.html). My research interests revolve around the intersection of service operations management, human behavior, and technology. By understanding the behaviors of managers, front-line employees, and customers in service settings, especially in contexts involving advanced technologies, I aim to generate insights that can significantly benefit practical applications in the operations managment field.
