  * We designed and ran an incentivized laboratory experiment to establish the causal relationship between hiring schemes and social auditor decisions. Through it, we studied how auditors process information, form beliefs, and make decisions influenced by profit motives and concerns for affected workers and clients. We find that auditors behave more leniently, driven by economic and reciprocal concerns, not when the suppliers only pay them but when they both pay and choose them. 
  
# **Work in Progress**

* **Reference-dependent effects in volunteering: Expected vs. experienced effort** with Leon Valdes and Mahyar Eftekhar. In progress. <!-- [[Slides]](https://tcui-pitt.github.io/files/Ratings_INFORMS23.pptx) -->
  * We seek to examine how an experienced mismatch between expected and actual effort in a task affects people's perception of the task and their decision to engage in it again. We aim to compare this between a commercial and a volunteering setting in an incentivized experiment to understand the rational and behavioral drivers behind people's reactions in both contexts.  
 
* **On the joint use of auditing and training to motivate supplier social responsibility** with Leon Valdes. In progress. <!-- [[Slides]](https://tcui-pitt.github.io/files/Ratings_INFORMS23.pptx) -->
  * We consider the differential impacts of a buying company's reliance on auditing versus training their suppliers on their suppliers' decision to either actually improve their SR state or hide their true state via a game-theoretic model. Our preliminary results suggest that although auditing can backfire, training does not.
