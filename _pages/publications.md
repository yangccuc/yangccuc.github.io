<!--   * <details><summary>Abstract</summary> Online dating has recently become the most common way for new couples to meet, with three-in-ten Americans having used dating apps, and revenues from dating apps swelling to more than five billion annually. The majority of these dating apps earn revenue via subscription based pricing, where subscriptions for access to the app are sold at a fixed price. Subscription based pricing is a ubiquitous way to monetize mobile apps, however in the context of online dating is controversial as it potentially misaligns the incentives of the platform and its users. Another, less popular but more traditional monetization strategy is the contract based model, in which the dating app is contracted by the user to facilitate a search for a partner at some agreed upon one time price. The purpose of this work is to understand the profit and welfare trade-offs associated with either pricing strategy for online dating platforms. We present a natural and novel model for the operation of an online dating platform. In our model, we show that subscription pricing always achieves at least 36.7% of the profit earned by contract pricing for all market parameters, explaining its prevalence in practice. We then take a fine-grained approach and establish profit dominance relations between the two strategies when the marginal cost of operation is small or large, respectively. We show that in online settings contract pricing is guaranteed to yield higher profit. Further, under a natural slow matching condition, we show that in online settings profit maximizing contract pricing leads to a higher percentage of the user-base getting matched. Finally, we show that contract pricing allows the platform to incorporate user preference information in a way that aligns the interest of the platform and user, solving the potential incentive issues that plague subscription pricing. </details> -->

<!--   * <details><summary>Abstract</summary> With the rapid development of data-driven analytics, many firms have begun experimenting with personalized pricing strategies, i.e. strategies that predict a customer's valuation then offer them a tailored price. Ideally, a firm would perfectly predict each customer's valuation and price their goods accordingly. Unfortunately, in practice these valuations must be predicted by the firm using noisy regression models, and the number of prices the firm can offer is constrained by operational considerations. In this work, we give a general framework for analyzing and optimizing semi-personalized pricing strategies where the seller uses features about their customers to jointly segment and price their market. Specifically, we show how a seller can leverage a noisy valuation model to construct segmentation and pricing decisions with provable bounds on the lost revenue. We then give a series of the results that explain how a seller can improve their strategies by decomposing their lost profits as stemming from either prediction error or limited price flexibility. Along the way we prove a number of structural properties about monopoly pricing when valuations are the output of a regression model that may be of independent interest. </details> -->

<!--   * <details><summary>Abstract</summary> We investigate the relationship between competition and market composition on prosocial corporate behaviors, with a focus on the adoption and proliferation of green technologies. We examine a model in which producers offer one of two substitutable goods: one that is inexpensive to produce but less environmentally responsible, referred to as the \textit{non-green} product, and another that is more costly but sustainably produced, referred to as the \textit{green} product. The producers of these goods can either cooperate or compete in the market, controlling both their price and level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in order to maximize revenue. Using Salop's circle model, we examine a variety of arrangements of green and non-green producers and analyze the equilibrium policies that result. We find that in markets where firms produce both green and non-green goods, a reduction in the additional cost of green manufacturing induces more green investment and prosocial corporate investment when producers cooperate. On the other hand, when the green product is absent from the market, reductions in green production cost can more readily lead to the introduction of the green good in competitive markets. These results have significant implications for policy-making, as they provide insight into which types of markets are most affected by reductions in the cost of green goods, such as those resulting from government subsidies or technological innovation. </details> -->
