<!--   * <details><summary>Abstract</summary> Online dating has recently become the most common way for new couples to meet, with three-in-ten Americans having used dating apps, and revenues from dating apps swelling to more than five billion annually. The majority of these dating apps earn revenue via subscription based pricing, where subscriptions for access to the app are sold at a fixed price. Subscription based pricing is a ubiquitous way to monetize mobile apps, however in the context of online dating is controversial as it potentially misaligns the incentives of the platform and its users. Another, less popular but more traditional monetization strategy is the contract based model, in which the dating app is contracted by the user to facilitate a search for a partner at some agreed upon one time price. The purpose of this work is to understand the profit and welfare trade-offs associated with either pricing strategy for online dating platforms. We present a natural and novel model for the operation of an online dating platform. In our model, we show that subscription pricing always achieves at least 36.7% of the profit earned by contract pricing for all market parameters, explaining its prevalence in practice. We then take a fine-grained approach and establish profit dominance relations between the two strategies when the marginal cost of operation is small or large, respectively. We show that in online settings contract pricing is guaranteed to yield higher profit. Further, under a natural slow matching condition, we show that in online settings profit maximizing contract pricing leads to a higher percentage of the user-base getting matched. Finally, we show that contract pricing allows the platform to incorporate user preference information in a way that aligns the interest of the platform and user, solving the potential incentive issues that plague subscription pricing. </details> -->

<!--   * <details><summary>Abstract</summary> Online media platforms such as Spotify, YouTube Music, and NetEase Cloud Music rely on long-term user engagement for revenue generation. The primary operational level under their control is content recommendation (i.e., what content to recommend to various users), where the right recommendation can induce users to further interact with the platform, sign-up for premium memberships, view ads, and more. However, given constantly updating supply (i.e., new content being created) and heterogeneous user behavior, optimal recommendation is challenging. It requires a careful balance between exploration (understanding the efficacy of new content) and exploitation (recommending well understood existing content). Motivated by a real-world impressions level dataset from NetEase Cloud Music, we propose a two-period model for the platform recommendation problem, with the aim of maximizing long term user engagement. Our model captures two key features of this marketplace: (1) supply-side learning (i.e., platform learning the efficacy of new content) and (2) demand-side heterogeneous churning (i.e., different users churning at different rates as a function of both their engagement and their types). We use our two-period model to understand the interplay between churning while learning and how it impacts the long-term user engagement. In addition to characterizing the structure of the optimal learning policy for the platform recommendation problem (i.e., which users to experiment on), we numerically illustrate our key findings on a wide range of parameters. We find that accounting for heterogeneous churning behavior while learning the efficacy of new content can lead to improvements of up to 14% in the long-term user engagement. </details> -->

<!--   * <details><summary>Abstract</summary> In this work, we describe some of the challenges Black-owned businesses face both in the United States and specifically in the city of Pittsburgh. Taking into account local dynamics and the communicated desires of Black-owned businesses in the Pittsburgh region, we determine that university students represent an under-utilized market for these businesses. We investigate the root causes for this inefficiency and design and implement a platform, 412Connect (\url{https://www.412connect.org/}), to increase online support for Pittsburgh Black-owned businesses from students in the greater university community. The site operates by coordinating interactions between student users and participating businesses via targeted recommendations. For platform designers, we describe the project from its conception, paying special attention to our motivation and design choices. Our design choices are aided by two simple, novel models for badge design and recommendation systems that may be of theoretical interest. We also highlight challenges and lessons from coordinating a grassroots volunteer project working in conjunction with community partners, and the opportunities and pitfalls of engaged scholarship. </details> -->

<!--   * <details><summary>Abstract</summary> With the rapid development of data-driven analytics, many firms have begun experimenting with personalized pricing strategies, i.e. strategies that predict a customer's valuation then offer them a tailored price. Ideally, a firm would perfectly predict each customer's valuation and price their goods accordingly. Unfortunately, in practice these valuations must be predicted by the firm using noisy regression models, and the number of prices the firm can offer is constrained by operational considerations. In this work, we give a general framework for analyzing and optimizing semi-personalized pricing strategies where the seller uses features about their customers to jointly segment and price their market. Specifically, we show how a seller can leverage a noisy valuation model to construct segmentation and pricing decisions with provable bounds on the lost revenue. We then give a series of the results that explain how a seller can improve their strategies by decomposing their lost profits as stemming from either prediction error or limited price flexibility. Along the way we prove a number of structural properties about monopoly pricing when valuations are the output of a regression model that may be of independent interest. </details> -->
