I use empirical methods to study human behavior and decision-making regarding the use of operational technologies in service settings, as visualized in the figure below. A better understanding of these aspects can increase service process efficiency, improve service quality, and help service organizations enhance human well-being.  While my primary discipline is operations management, my research also draws inspiration and intelligence from other fields, including information systems and psychology.

  * It is well-established that worker fatigue can have deleterious consequences for work quality. However, less is known about how shift structure – an operational policy decision – influences worker fatigue. We collected primary data through a month-long fatigue-monitoring program we developed and implemented in an emergency department at a large, midwestern, academic hospital. Using a combination of nonparametric and econometrics models, we found that both the duration of a shift and its timing (i.e., when the shift starts) have important and differential impacts on workers’ perceived physical and mental fatigue. In addition, we observed that time spent on either extra-clinical professional responsibilities or personal chores reduces the efficacy of a clinician’s recovery time in terms of fatigue reduction. In contrast, we find that time spent with family and loved ones can significantly improve the effectiveness of fatigue recovery periods between work shifts. We conclude that scheduling policies that mitigate the physical and mental fatigue induced by shift work and allow for enhanced fatigue recovery between shifts should be preferred by organizations concerned with both employee well-being and consistently high service quality. 
  
# **Work in Progress**
* **[2]:Effect of Task and Temporal Attributes on Customers’ Decisions to Use Self-Service Technologies** with Yinghao Zhang and Craig Froehle. In progress.
  * Self-service technologies (SSTs) are being increasingly implemented across various service industries, including financial, retail, and healthcare. Early research highlighted the benefits of SSTs for service organizations, emphasizing cost reduction and productivity enhancement. Recent studies have shifted their focus toward understanding the factors that motivate customers’ decisions to use SSTs. These studies have primarily concentrated on the factors of customer characteristics (e.g., personality, technology attitude, self-efficacy, and prior experience) and system design (e.g., convenience, ease of use, controllability, flexibility, supportiveness, and enjoyment). However, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding situational factors that can influence customers’ decisions. Hence, our study focuses on two such factors: Task Complexity and Time Pressure. This leads to our research question: How do task complexity and time pressure influence customers’ preferences of using self-service technologies? To answer this question, we designed and conducted online experiments to observe people’s SSTs preferences under a simulated grocery checkout environment. This research method is novel compared to the previous literature, which typically relies on scenario-based surveys to examine people’s general perceptions and choices. Our study contributes to the existing literature by examining situational factors as determinants of customers’ decisions to use service technology; where knowing how such factors affect customers’ decisions is insightful for organizations to make better decisions about investing and allocating self-service technologies to improve operational and financial performances.  
 
* **[3]:Influence of Task and Anthropomorphism on Customers’ Perceived Failure Risk with an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Service Agent** with Craig Froehle and Yinghao Zhang. In progress.
  * AI service agents (AISA) are increasingly common, even in healthcare. However, customers' experiences have been highly variable, with few firms fully realizing the operational benefits they expected. Using a combination of experimental and survey methods, we study how operational and behavioral factors drive customer-AISA interactions, satisfaction, and abandonment.
